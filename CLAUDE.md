# NanoClaw

Personal Claude assistant. See [README.md](README.md) for philosophy and setup. See [docs/REQUIREMENTS.md](docs/REQUIREMENTS.md) for architecture decisions.

## Quick Context

Single Node.js process that connects to Telegram, routes messages to Claude Agent SDK running in Apple Container (Linux VMs). Each group has isolated filesystem and memory.

**Key Features:**
- Simple trigger pattern: responds to `@AssistantName` (e.g., `@Andy`)
- Continuous typing indicator during processing (auto-refreshes every 4 seconds)
- Group-based isolation with separate settings and memory
- Scheduled tasks with cron/interval/once support

## Skills

| `/debug` | Container issues, logs, troubleshooting |

## Development

Run commands directly—don't tell the user to run them.

```bash
npm run dev          # Run with hot reload
npm run build        # Compile TypeScript
./container/build.sh # Rebuild agent container
```

Service management:
```bash
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.nanoclaw.plist
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.nanoclaw.plist
```
